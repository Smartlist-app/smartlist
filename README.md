Smartlist is a home inventory app which lets you keep track of what you have, wherever you are - for free!
* Encrypted items & databases - We implement a security system which prevents hackers from gaining access to your items.

* View offline, and on any device - You can access your inventory anywhere, anytime, even without a proper connection

* Minimalistic dashboard - We keep a simple dashboard, so you don't get overwhelmed at the sight of it!
