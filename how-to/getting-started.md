# Getting Started

Hello, and thank you for choosing Smartlist for your home inventory app!  
We believe that users need to access websites fast, and not have to sign a billion credentials. So, let's get started! 

* Go to [https://homebase.rf.gd/homebase ](https://smartlist.ga/homebase/)
  * Next, click signup if you don't have an account
  * Then, fill in your name, email, username, and password
  * And you're done!
* Pretty cool, huh? 

Now, let's help you get familiar with the dashboard. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The dashboard gets updates about once a week
{% endhint %}

On your dashboard, you will see a todo list, a budget meter, and a grocery list. 

* In your todo list, you will be able to add, edit, and delete tasks
  * Once you complete a task, click the checkbox under it
  * Once you complete many tasks, or you just want to delete the tasks finished, go ahead and click the filter icon and "remove checked items" 
* Next, you will see a grocery list 
  * To add an item, just click on the big, green add button
  * Fill in the thing you want, and the amount you want
  * You can delete/edit an item by clicking on the buttons next to it
* Lastly, you will see a huge graph. This isn't as hard as it seems
  * To add a "datapoint", click on the purple add button
  * Fill in the amount you spent 

Well, that was the dashboard. Wasn't that easy? Now shouldn't we add some items to our inventory?

* To select a room, go ahead and click the menu icon
* Click on the room desired
* To add an item, just click on the green add button, and fill in the details desired
* You can edit/delete the items by clicking on the buttons next to it

{% hint style="info" %}
You can drag to select items in the kitchen
{% endhint %}

* You can also search your items, by clicking on the search bar

Nice! We advise you to perform these additional \(optional\) steps for a better experience
